***Please analyze time/space complexities for each problem in report.txt.

1. Given an RNA sequence, such as ACAGU, we can predict its secondary structure 
   by tagging each nucleotide as (, ., or ). Each matching pair of () must be 
   AU, GC, or GU (or their mirror symmetries: UA, CG, UG). 
   We also assume pairs can _not_ cross each other. 


2. Total number of all possible structures



3. k-best structures: output the 1-best, 2nd-best, ... kth-best structures.



ANSWERS:
    1. best
        Time complexities: O(n^3)
        Space complexities: O(n^2)
    2. total:
        Time complexities: O(n^3)
        Space complexities: O(n^2)
    3. kbest:
        Time complexities: O(n^2 + n^2 * klogk)
        Space complexities: O(n^2 * k)
